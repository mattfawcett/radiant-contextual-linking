ContextualLinking
=================

This plugin allows you to use the tag contextual_links to display some contextual links on the page that are related to the current page. It matches the value of the keywords that you define when adding/editing a page. It default to displaying 3 links if it can find that many matches. 
The links will be displayed in an unordered list.
This is an experimental plugin used to demo contextual linking and I am not currently using it any productions sites.
